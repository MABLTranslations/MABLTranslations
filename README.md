⚡ I’m passionate about the intersection of translation, artificial intelligence, and database management. I believe that learning how to create and manage databases and gaining knowledge in technology and AI is a valuable asset for a translator. This expertise facilitates communication with tech-oriented teams in software localization projects and proves essential in academic projects that require handling large amounts of data and leveraging new technologies.
